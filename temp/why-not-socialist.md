When I was young, I was a socialist. I thought it just seemed more fair than capitalism. Socialism meant everyone had a chance to succeed, and something to fall back on if they failed. Capitalism was just a dirty trick used by the rich to stay rich and oppress the poor.

I changed my mind in college, and it's kind of a funny story how it happened.

I had a conservative friend in college, at Rutgers University. We would argue about politics some time. Like most political debates, nothing was ever resolved. Neither one of us was convincing enough to actually convince the other of something.

Except this one time, he said something that stuck with me. Something along the lines of:

> Hey, you know how Paul Robeson has like 8 things named after him on campus, even though he was a Stalinist? Milton Friedman is also a Rutgers graduate, and he won a Nobel Prize, and he has nothing named after him. His big crime is being a Republican. Isn't it weird that it's worse to be a Republican than a Stalinist here?

It is true that both Paul Robeson and Milton Friedman were famous alumni of Rutgers. And even if you consider the Economics Nobel Prize to be a fake Nobel Prize, we don't really have that many famous alumni at Rutgers. A fake Nobel Prize should still be good enough to get something named after you!

And it's also true that Paul Robeson was a Stalinist. He persisted in supporting Stalin even after his horrific crimes became known in the West.

You can certainly argue that maybe Robeson had some understandable blind spots due to the racism he experienced as a black man in America in the early 20th century. So I'm not saying that Robeson doesn't deserve to have some stuff named after him. But why nothing for Friedman?

I read a little more about Milton Friedman and learned that, in addition to being an economist, he was also a public figure. He tried to communicate his views on economics to regular people through interviews, TV appearances, and writing.

I wondered, what if my friend is right? What if I haven't been exposed to good arguments in favor of capitalism, because everyone around me is so biased that they think Ronald Reagan was worse than Stalin?

So I went to the library and got one of Friedman's books: [Free to Choose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_to_Choose), which is basically an argument in favor of capitalism written.

I read the book.

And... well, I'm not saying I agreed with every last word, but for the most part, it was very convincing. I had indeed never been exposed to good arguments in favor of capitalism. I had never thought about fundamental things like how supply and demand set prices of goods, and how those prices serve as signals that propagate through the economy, and all this dynamically results in efficient resource usage, and how all of that would be insanely difficult without capitalism.
