[Basketball GM](https://basketball-gm.com/) is a pretty fucking successful video game. As I write this, there are 600 people playing BBGM, plus another 400 playing the other sports. So in some sense it's 1000 total because all the sports are really the same game.

And that's not new. I share [my usage statistics](https://zengm.com/blog/2024/01/2023-traffic-stats/) and we're now going on several years where there are hundreds of people playing BBGM every second of every day. This number has been increasing too, although it's possible when I look at the 2024 statistics it'll be a bit down from 2023. But even at the current level, with no growth or maybe even some decline, BBGM is a pretty popular video game.

How popular? Well it's hard to exactly compare to other video games. If you look at [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/charts/) you can see how many people are playing games on Steam currently, and obviously BBGM is never going to have a million plus people playing it like Counter-Strike 2 does.

600 people playing currently would rank me #814 on Steam, and 1000 (if I merge all sports into one) would rank #610.


Many popular games aren't on Steam at all, and some games are on Steam and other platforms, so the Steam users are only a fraction of the total. But I also have some users who are not tracked by Google Analytics due to ad blockers or playing offline.
