title: The HR poll incident
---

My last job was at a big corporate company. Naturally we had a fancy internal HR website where the HR people would post information for us workers.

For some reason, they put a monthly poll of some random topic on that website. And it was always something kind of generic and boring, like "what is your favorite genre of music" or "what is your favorite type of vacation" or whatever.

I figured, this looks completely useless and boring, so why don't we have some fun with it?

I decided to take the weirdest available poll option and rig the vote. I thought it would bring a tiny amount of fun to my coworkers' days. Like you go to the HR website, you see some boring poll like "what's your favorite musical instrument" and when you look at the results you see that 99.999% of the company prefers the oboe. That at least gives you a slighty smile, right?

Ah, but how to rig the vote? Turns out it was pretty easy, it let you vote as many times as you want. So I wrote a little script to vote a million times. The only tricky part was that the website itself was password protected, so I did have to make my script log in first. But no big deal. And that even made me feel better about it, because if someone in HR really wanted to stop me from doing this, they could just send me an email asking me not to do it, or block my account, or something. I mean even without the mandatory log in they could have done that, since I was doing this from my official work computer connected to the company's network, so they could have also blocked my IP address or figured out who I was from that.

So I was not really concerned that I was causing anyone any trouble. I thought it was just a funny little thing that other people would find mildly amusing.

Apparently HR thought otherwise! Turns out some higher-up in HR cared a great deal about the integreity of their polls. Sadly, no one in HR had the technical competence to associate my millions of votes with my logged-in user account or my IP address, either of which would have identified me. Instead they went through a months-long investigation and ultimately wound up hiring some contractors to come in and figure out what was going on.

After spending so much money and effort to figure out why their polls were messed up, HR was very angry. So angry that they didn't even come talk to me about it, they went to my boss. They were out for blood. But they didn't realize that my boss was probably the one person in the entire company who was most similar to me, so he couldn't keep a straight face when they explained the situation to him and demanded some serious action be taken. (Also, my boss already knew I was rigging the polls because I had told him about it previously, since I thought it was funny!)

So they go to my boss's boss. He also already knew I was doing it and thought it was funny. He was better at keeping a straight face, but HR was still not satisfied that appropriate action would be taken.

Ultimately they went to my boss's boss's boss's boss, who was a quite high ranking person in the company. Unfortunately for HR, I had a good relationship with this entire chain of bosses, and they all thought the situation was kind of funny.

The end of the story is that my boss's boss's boss's boss asked me to stop doing it and to apologize to HR. And I did. Because I was nevAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaa
