Welcome to my blog! Here, you will mainly find me writing about whatever interests me at the moment. Since I am a predictably simple man, most of my posts are about [sports](/tag/sports/), [science](/tag/science/), and [programming](/tag/programming/), with an occasional foray into [politics](/tag/politics/) if I'm really bored. My favorite posts include:

* [Retrospective bioinformatics: the feasibility overlapping genetic codes](/2011/06/retrospective-bioinformatics-the-feasibility-overlapping-genetic-codes/)
* [My previous life as a programmer/entrepreneur](/2011/08/my-previous-life-as-a-programmerentrepreneur-part-1-origins/)
* [Butgers University](/2012/04/butgers-university/)
* [Vote and die: are you more likely to cast the deciding vote in the election, or to die on your way to your polling place?](/2012/09/vote-and-die/)
* [Did Adrian Peterson actually rush for more yards than Eric Dickerson but have it go unnoticed due to measurement error?](/2013/01/did-adrian-peterson-actually-rush-for-more-yards-than-eric-dickerson-but-have-it-go-unnoticed-due-to-measurement-error/)

All my posts are listed below, in chronological order.
