[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) is a great website containing a bunch of fun math/programming puzzles. I've been very gradually working through their puzzles for years, whenever I am bored or decide that I haven't solved enough brain teasers recently. Unfortunately they don't seem to have any kind of public profile except this badge:
