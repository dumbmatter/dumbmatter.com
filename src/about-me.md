Hello. My name is Jeremy.

Through a strange series of events, <a href="https://zengm.com/blog/2021/01/full-time-job/">I am currently a self-employed indie video game developer</a>.

Before that, I was a data scientist at <a href="https://www.covance.com/">Covance</a> trying to make clinical trials run a bit more smoothly. Before that, I was a research scientist at <a href="http://bhsai.org/">BHSAI</a> studying the heat shock response. Before that (this list is getting too long), I got a PhD from the <a href="https://bme.rutgers.edu/">Department of Biomedical Engineering</a> at Rutgers University, where I worked with <a href="https://www.ipandro.com/">Dr. Ioannis P. Androulakis</a> on computational systems biology of inflammation. If you're curious about more work-related stuff, <a href="/files/cv.pdf">here is my full CV (a few years out of date now)</a>.

In my free time, I like creating things. My most notable creation is <a href="https://basketball-gm.com/">Basketball GM</a>, the Internet's premier basketball management simulation video game. But I've done <a href="/projects/">some other cool stuff</a> too, so hopefully at least a few of <a href="/">my blog posts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dumbmatter">GitHub projects</a> are interesting.

You can find me all over the Internet:
