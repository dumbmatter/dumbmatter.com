Hello. My name is Jeremy.

Through a strange series of events, <a href="https://zengm.com/blog/2021/01/full-time-job/">I am currently a self-employed indie video game developer</a>, most notably of <a href="https://basketball-gm.com/">Basketball GM</a>, the Internet's premier basketball management simulation video game. As someone who loves programming and sports, being able to work on sports simulation games full time is pretty awesome!

Before getting into the video game business, I was a computational biologist. I don't really do any of that anymore, but you can find my old publications on my <a href="/projects/">projects page</a> or on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1y7uO8kAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a>.

In my free time, I like creating things. In addition to <a href="https://zengm.com/">my video games</a>, I've done <a href="/projects/">some other cool stuff</a> too, so hopefully you find at least a few of <a href="/">my blog posts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dumbmatter">GitHub projects</a> are interesting.

If you'd like to chat about any of this, feel free to <a href="mailto:jdscheff@gmail.com">email me</a> or message me on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dumbmatter/">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://zengm.com/discord/">Discord (dumbmatter#9184)</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/basketball_gm">Twitter</a>.
