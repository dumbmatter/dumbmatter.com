title: A skeptical reading of Switzerland vs. the United States
---

<p>Chantal Panozzo wrote an article over at Vox about how awesome Switzerland is and how shitty the US is. But, as it always is with the media these days, the real question is, how true is the article?</p>

<!--more-->

<p>It starts with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the average Swiss worker earned the equivalent of $91,574 a year in 2013, while the average American worker earned only $55,708.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However those income numbers are not adjusted for cost of living. The same exact source Panozzo linked to also contains <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?QueryId=64115">PPP normalized data</a> which shows that the average American worker actually makes more money than the average Swiss worker after normalizing for cost of living (although at #1 and #3 in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development">OECD</a>, both countries are quite propserous). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity">Normalizing for cost of living</a> is literally the most important thing to do when comparing money across regions.</p>

<p>I briefly considered doing a postdoc in Switzerland after grad school, and basically the first thing I learned when researching the opportunity was that Switzerland was really fucking expensive. That should have been even more obvious for someone like Panozzo who actually lived in Switzerland. So in not accounting for cost of living, is she being careless? Oblivious? Or biased? Don't form your opinion yet. Let's read some more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the real story is that the average American had to work 219 hours more per year for this lesser salary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This number is actually correct. Let's look at it in context of <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=ANHRS">all OECD countries</a>. The US is #15 in hours worked, which is just slightly above average. Switzerland is #29. There are several countries with far fewer hours worked than Switzerland, such as Germany which was 197 hours less than Switzerland. But it does seem true that people in some countries tend to work less than people in the US.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which brings us to lunch. In Switzerland, you don't arrive to a meeting late, but you also don't leave for your lunch break a second past noon. If it's summer, jumping into the lake to swim with the swans is an acceptable way to spend your lunch hour. If you eat a sandwich at your desk, people will scold you. I learned this the hard way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's all anecdotes, so let me provide my own. I would hate to have to take an hour lunch break every day. I'd rather eat a quick lunch at my desk and then finish my work an hour earlier. In an ideal job, I think each individual worker should be allowed to make that decision for themselves, but I have no idea how common that type of arrangement is in the US or Switzerland.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Weekends in Switzerland encourage leisure time, too. On Sundays, you can't even shop — most stores are closed. You are semi-required to hike in the Alps with your family. It's just what you do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that actually a good thing for the poor? Imagine if you were a retail worker. You already are making a below average salary. Would you like to be forced to work less hours by having your store closed every Sunday?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Swiss have a culture of professional part-time work, and as a result, part-time jobs include every benefit of a full-time job, including vacation time and payment into two Swiss pension systems. Salaries for part-time work are set as a percentage of a professional full-time salary­ because unlike in the United States, part-time jobs are not viewed as necessarily unskilled jobs with their attendant lower pay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout this whole section, no actual data is presented, and I don't have any either. So who knows how accurate any of this is. It's not like every worker in the US works 40+ hours/week.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Compared with taxes in the United States, Swiss taxes are easy on the average worker. For example, a worker earning the average wage of $91,574 would pay only about 5 percent of that in Swiss federal income tax. Instead of taxing salaries at high percentages — a practice that puts most of the tax burden on the middle class, where most income comes from wages and not from capital gains — Switzerland immediately taxes dividends at a maximum of 35 percent and also has a wealth-based tax.</p>
<p>While the American tax system is supposed to be progressive — so the more you earn, the more taxes you pay — up to 39.6 percent tax for the highest income brackets, the superrich escape paying these kind of taxes because they aren't making most of their money in wages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's all great, but none of that information indicates that the Swiss tax system is actually more progressive than the American tax system. I don't blame Panozzo for missing that piece of the puzzle, because the two tax systems are so complicated that it is quite difficult to compare them. For instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax#Switzerland">Switzerland has no capital gains tax</a>. Can you imagine the rage that would spew from places like Vox if an American politician proposed a scheme like that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, in 2010, Mitt Romney, whose total income was $21.6 million, paid only $3 million in taxes, or a tax rate of about 14 percent, which is amazing when you consider this is the same tax rate American families earning wages from about $16,750 to $68,000 paid in 2010.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that's some spin. Let me more clearly rephrase what she wrote: Romney paid 14% in federal income taxes in 2010, but the marginal tax rate for American familites on dollars earned between $16,750 and $68,000 was 15%. Obviously those quantities are not directly comparible.</p>

<p>Conveniently for Panozzo's narrative, her muddled description made it sound like Romney actually paid the same federal income tax rate as American families who earned between $16,750 and $68,000. In reality, due to our progressive tax bracket system, families with incomes in that range all paid less than Romney, even if they took literally no deductions at all on their taxes. And of course, after deductions, the average family in that range <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/01/18/news/economy/Romney_effective_tax_rate/">probably paid something around $0</a> in federal income taxes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The average adult in Switzerland has a net worth worth of $513,000 according to the 2013 Credit Suisse Wealth Report. Average net worth among adults in the US is half that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember what I wrote about cost of living adjustment above? That accounts for approximately all of this difference. If I wanted to go off on a Trumpian tangent I could also mention the millions of poor immigrants living in the US and ask how many impovrished third worlders are deemed worthy of living in the paradise that is Switzerland, but I'll leave that for another day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At my former American job, I received 10 days of paid vacation per year, and each of those days came with a sizable portion of guilt if actually used. But in Switzerland, my husband's company gave employees six weeks of vacation a year. Most of the Swiss companies I worked for gave four — the legal minimum is four. Moreover, everything shut down between Christmas and New Year's, giving most employees like me another guaranteed week off.</p>
<p>People in Europe took vacation seriously. Once, when I only took 10 days for a trip to Spain, my colleagues chastised me for taking so little time off. I learned to take vacation chunks in two-week intervals. Well rested, I noticed that I felt more productive and creative when I returned to work. Recent American research confirms what I was feeling: Relaxing can make you more productive. So why don't Americans embrace vacation time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Valid point, I'll give her that one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not owning a car is financially freeing — and it saves the environment, too. In Switzerland, 21 percent of households do not own a car, versus 9.2 percent in the US.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now normalize for population density, or at least do something besides comparing the raw data from two very different countries. Switzerland could very well have more effective public transportation than the US, but that is not well illustrated with anecdotes. This could be a valid point from Panozzo, it's just hard to say from what's presented in the article.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Ranting about the US healthcare system]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Definitely valid!</p>

<p>So in total, we have a few valid points, a few points that are very obviously just spin, and a few points that are anecdotes that may or may not be indicative of underlying truths, but not enough data is presented to distinguish truth from fiction. More cynically... it's just enough truth to pass most peoples' bullshit detectors, and just enough spin to get the correct narrative across.</p>

<p>And this is on Vox. Vox, whose motto is "explain the news". Vox, which was intended to allow you to drill down to the general facts and logic beneath an article. Vox, which is not much more than generic blogspam today. So it goes for online media in 2015.</p>
