title: Two types of models
---

Clarification on "model": experimental, animal, mathematical, ...

There are two types of models: those that are useful or insightful, and those that aren't.

This isn't a particularly novel insight. "All models are wrong; some models are useful" is an adage which conveys a similar idea, and no one but a pedant would argue with that (I might be a pedant; I throw in "insightful" next to "useful", to include more basic scientific knowledge a level up from reasonable usefulness). However, that doesn't mean that scientists always live by that wisdom.

Too often, models are seen as ends in and of themselves, regardless of usefulness. This can arise from two different philosophies. First, the belief that a paper with a model is better than a paper without a model, even if the model isn't adding anything other than itself. Second, the belief that the existence of a model will plausibly lead to some more interesting result down the road, even if it doesn't really do that now. Of course, distinguishing between these and thus determining the true motivation of a modeler is difficult.

An example. Hhoffman - tacked on, what did we learn? MAKE SURE I VALIDATE THIS. You could also draw similar conclusions about models in some (but not all!) of my publications.

So what of these models lacking utility and insight? Are they useless? No, certainly not. Hoffman's NF-ÎºB model did spur future insight, for instance from people analyzing sensitivities to parameters and noise, or the effects of redundant pathways.

But the impact of Hoffman's model is not typical. The publication also had wonderful experimental results, a Nobel laureate co-author, and prominent dissemination through Science. Lacking those elements, it very possibly could have been ignored, as many modeling papers are. ****LINK TO PAPER ABOUT BIOLOGISTS TUNING OUT EQUATIONS***

So, what is useful and insightful? What features allow a model to stand on its own? At its most basic level, a model is information. It's a codified set of hypotheses and assumptions about the function of a system. As time progresses, there are more and more systems where increasingly plausible models either have been made or can be made. And every time one of those systems is analyzed in a model-free manner, something is left on the table. Not all information and knowledge is leveraged. This is the mindset and motivation that is pushing me in my latest work, which I will soon be traveling to a couple conferences to present and then hopefully shortly after that will be published.
