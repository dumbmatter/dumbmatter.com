- Back to promoting my own stuff. Freeipods stuff?
- People noticed what I was doing. Get emails out of the blue to buy ads.
- B (not by name). Sign exclusive contract, he can terminate whenever he wants. I figure.. why the fuck not? Besides, even if we had a no termination agreement, am I going to chase this guy around the country if he stops paying?
- R (not by name). Offers much better deal. Even came to see me in person about it. But I can't get out of B's contract for a few more months.
- Even better deal: guaranteed money by selling the website. Cause I don't trust B or R to keep paying if the golden goose dies. Start negotiating with B. Turn down a lower (yet still substantial) offer from a third party during this time. But B's people back out at the last minute.
- A little later, and the golden goose died. Google finally figured me out, after like 3 years. Still got some residual ad sales at this point, from people who didn't realize that I lost my magic. But I was basically out of the game at this point and focusing on my PhD rather than comiong up with the next scam.
