Economic optimist vs realist
• Left: More spending to stimulate economy
∘ Already had massive stimulus. Spending at record levels.
• Right: Cut taxes to stimulate economy
∘ Taxes are already at historic lows, as fraction of GDP. Incredibly low compared to other Western countries.
• Realist: Economy's not coming back. Fundamental problems are not taxes and stimulus
∘ Real issue: global wage arbitrage
∘ Problem: deficit. If we don't fix it, it will consume us. Left and Right think that temporary increases in the deficit will lead to long-term decreases. I doubt that. We need to address it now.
∘ Obama's "grand bargain" was pretty good, although we don't know specifics
