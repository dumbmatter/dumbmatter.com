title: What is dumb matter?
---

<p>I'm switching the main URL of this website from jeremyscheff.com to dumbmatter.com. It makes it a bit more elegant not to have my name in the title, doesn't it? I bet you feel a little classier already, just having read this. By the way, doesn't it seem like whenever someone is described as "classy" it really just means "this guy isn't a sociopathic criminal"? It always feels like almost an underhanded complement... like it's the least positive thing you could say about someone without criticizing him. But anyway...</p>

<p>Why that name? Well, from a certain perspective, scientists have two fundamental challenges:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reverse engineering the human brain to the point where we can run simulations of it... <i>i.e.</i> real artificial intelligence.</li>
<li>Presenting those simulations with as much computational power as possible.</li>
</ol>

<p>The phrase "dumb matter" relates to the second challenge. It comes from one of my favorite novels, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando_%28novel%29">Accelerando by Charles Stross</a>, in which technology has progressed so far that matter can be classified into two groups: <em>computronium</em> is matter that has been maximally leveraged for computational purposes, and <em>dumb matter</em> is everything else.</p>

<p>So, everything in the known universe (barring the HHGTTG interpretation) is dumb matter. Our greatest art. Our most insightful novels. Our fastest supercomputers. Even our most brilliant minds. All of it horribly dumb. And right now, I'm just one clump of dumb matter leveraging this other clump of dumb matter sitting on my desk in front of me to communicate with a few other clumps of dumb matter.</p>

<p>Googling "dumb matter" brings you to this cool site <a href="http://www.technovelgy.com/">Technovelgy</a> which gives <a href="http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=1511">this interesting note about the phrase</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"Dumb matter" is one of those wonderful sf terms like <a href="http://www.technovelgy.com/content.asp?Bnum=340">ground car</a>, <a href="http://www.technovelgy.com/content.asp?Bnum=1207">inert-wear</a> or <a href="http://www.technovelgy.com/content.asp?Bnum=1208">static home</a>. In each case, an sfnal idea is introduced, along with a related term for something commonplace you already know.</blockquote>
