title: PWA Summit 2022 presentation
---

Last week I gave a talk at [PWA Summit 2022](https://pwasummit.org/) which was a purely online conference. It was pretty fun. It was a lot of firsts for me:

- First talk on a non-science topic
- First talk at a programming conference
- First talk at a virtual conference
- First talk in many years!

The topic was client side storage in web apps, which was of course motivated by my work on [Basketball GM](https://basketball-gm.com/) and other games which store tons of data client side. It is frustrating how difficult that is, and how easy it is to experience data loss. But as I go over in my talk, there are at least some reasons to be optimistic for the future!
