title: Find the RSS feed URL for a Twitter user
---

<p><b>Update: June 2013</b>: Previously, this post contained information about how to access RSS feeds of Twitter user timelines so that you could read them in whatever RSS reader you wanted to. But now, those RSS feeds are completely deleted because Twitter is evil. However, it is still possible to recreate the RSS feeds if you jump through some hoops. Probably the easiest way is described <a href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/twitter-rss-feeds/27931/">in this blog post</a>. It'll take a couple minutes to set up, but then you can easily get an RSS feed for any Twitter timeline.</p>

    <p>Thank you much! Just what I was looking for. Why do they hide the RSS feed. Seems this should be something right out in the open. Hate it when they change things!</p>

    <p>Thanks! I&#8217;m using this twitter rss generator with IFTTT.com in a recipe to email me if a specific word is used.</p>
<p>One change I had to make though:<br />
take off the s in &#8220;https&#8221; so that it doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a secure site feed or else the recipe can&#8217;t be created.</p>
