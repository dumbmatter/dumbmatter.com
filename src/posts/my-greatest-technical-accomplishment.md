title: My greatest technical accomplishment
---

Since this is my blog, it makes sense to talk about the greatest technical accomplishment of my life.

...except I already wrote a long blog post about it. Just not here, over on [the ZenGM blog](https://zengm.com/blog/2017/04/basketball-gm-4-0-technical-details/).

TLDR: I got an order of magnitude performance improvement out of a mature piece of software, with no negative tradeoffs from an end user perspective.
