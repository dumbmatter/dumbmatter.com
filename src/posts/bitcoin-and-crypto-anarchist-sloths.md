title:  Bitcoin and crypto-anarchist sloths

When I first heard of <a href="http://www.weusecoins.com/">BitCoin</a>, a decentralized (i.e. not controlled by a government or corporation) digital currency, I immediately thought of Neal Stephenson. Why? Well, I have a total mancrush on Neal Stephenson, so he is never far from my thoughts. But a central theme of several of his novels (and a peripheral theme in others) is currency. For instance, in Cryptonomicon, the protagonists are developing a digital currency which is "anonymous, untraceable, and untaxable", but ultimately there is still some gold sitting in a vault somewhere centralized.

But Stephenson's short story <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982610-1,00.html">"The Great Simoleon Caper"</a> is even more prescient:

> "Any kind of E-money consists of numbers moving around on wires," I say. "If you know how to keep your numbers secret, your currency is safe. If you don't, it's not. Keeping numbers secret is a problem of cryptography - a branch of mathematics. Well, Joe, the crypto-anarchists showed me their math. And it's good math. It's better than the math the government uses. Better than Simoleons' math too. No one can mess with CryptoCredits."

Interestingly, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin+%22the+great+simoleon+caper%22">not too many people seem to have made this connection</a>.

Bitcoin is an incredibly intriguing idea. Especially in the context of WikiLeaks, where Paypal, Visa, and Mastercard decided not to process donations to WikiLeaks. A couple weeks ago I bought some Bitcoins through a nifty Paypal site (which have since tripled in value), but that has predictably been <a href="http://marketcut.com/bitcoin-btc/so-long-coinpal-and-thanks-for-all-the-bitcoinsafter-selling/">shut down</a>.

An anonymous, untraceable currency would (<a href="http://xkcd.com/538/">theoretically</a>) lie beyond the control of any government or corporate entity, for better or worse. I can't imagine the government (and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing">the Fed</a>) would take kindly to that concept. If I had any faith that the various benevolent governments of the world wouldn't crush Bitcoin into a mushy pulp if it ever got popular, I would be even more interested in all this digital, decentralized currency stuff.
