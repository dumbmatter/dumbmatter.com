Which NBA players take the most shots with their foot on the three point line? If you want the answer to that question, check out the post I wrote [on the ZenGM blog](https://zengm.com/blog/2019/08/foot-on-the-line/).

Why there and not here? I figure, when the hordes of highly interested basketball fans find this spectacular blog post, I'd rather BBGM gets some shine than dumbmatter.com.
