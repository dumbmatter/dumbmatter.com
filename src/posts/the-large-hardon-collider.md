title: The Large Hardon Collider
---

The Large <em>Hadron</em> Collider is a marvel of modern technology. It is also an endless source of juvenile amusement, since the word "hadron" is very similar to <a href="http://largehardoncollider.com/">"hardon"</a>. The Large Hadron Collider was built by the European research organization CERN (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prldarQnrnw&t=39s">"CERN" means "science" in European</a>). At CERN's official website, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22large+hardon+collider%22+site%3Acern.ch">there are currently 141 articles which mistakenly use the word "hardon" instead of "hadron"</a>. The first result is the title of one poor guy's PhD thesis.
