title: What happened to the Pete Buttigieg "High Hopes" dance?
---

In November 2019, a few videos appeared online showing some Pete Buttigieg supporters doing a corny dance to Panic! at the Disco's "High Hopes". [Here's one](https://twitter.com/MatthewBevan/status/1195975381762789376), [and another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXTLBhe-ccU), and [yet another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs7xDde5g3I).

The oldest video I can find is [this one](https://twitter.com/conor_mcconor/status/1189032269706452992) from October 29, 2019, which is attached to a tweet saying "I taught everybody at the Nevada Day Parade the High Hopes dance. Study up, weâ€™ll be doing it a lot!"

That Tweet, along with the rapid release of all those different videos, suggested to me that this was not an isolated incident. Crazed Mayor Pete fans must be doing that lame dance all over the place!

I was excited to see more videos. But sadly that never happened. Those are still the only four Pete Buttigieg dance videos I have ever seen.

So what happened? Did Mayor Pete decide to crush the high hopes of his supporters by banning their fun little dance? Or are they still doing it, but with extreme levels of security to prevent further online ridicule?
