title: CSV SQL Live
---

I made <a href="/csv-sql-live/">another mini project for no apparent reason</a>. You can load one or many CSV files into a SQL database within your web browser (client side) and run SQL queries on them. In most situations it's not that useful (most databases already support importing CSVs without too much trouble), but it might save somebody some time in a pinch. And it's cool that things like this are even possible, purely client side.
